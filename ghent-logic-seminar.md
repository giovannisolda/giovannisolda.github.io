The Ghent Logic Seminar takes place weekly, usually at 11pm (CET) on Thursdays. Most of the seminars can be attended either in person or on Zoom. For the zoom link, get in touch with [Andreas Weiermann](http://cage.ugent.be/~weierman/), [Fedor Pakhomov](https://research.ugent.be/web/person/fedor-pakhomov-0/en), or me.
