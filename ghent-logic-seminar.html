  <details><summary>Title: Quantitative Probabilistic Fixed-Point Logic and the Problem of Satisfiability</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: I will be presenting the research that I have done for my Master's Thesis in the area of probabilistic fixed-point modal logic. The main focus will be on a tableau construction that I have developed with the aim of addressing the satisfiability problem of a specific probabilistic fixed-point logic setup.

  <details><summary>Title: On the termination of some recursive algorithms</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: Erickson, Nivasch, and Xu (2021), while studying so-called "fusible numbers", considered the following recursive algorithm \(M(x)\): if \(x<0\) return \(−x\), else return \(M(x−M(x−1))/2\). They showed that \(M\) terminates on real inputs, and that PA cannot prove that \(M\) terminates on all natural inputs. In this talk we investigate conditions under which similar recursive algorithms terminate on all real inputs. <br>

  <details><summary>Title: Monotone versus non-monotone projective operators</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: For \(\Gamma = \Sigma^1_n\) or \(\Pi^1_n\), the closure ordinal of monotone \(\Gamma\) operators is smaller than the closure ordinal of \(\Gamma\) operators, assuming \(V=L\) or \(\mathsf{PD}\). Half the inequalities are due to Aanderaa (1974) and the rest are new and joint with Philip Welch.

  <details><summary>Title: Finite leaf-labeled trees ordered by non-inf-preserving embeddings</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: As indicated in the title, the subject of the talk will be a certain well-quasi-order of leaf-labeled trees with an ordering which is weaker than the usual Kruskal embedding. The primary goal is the calculation of maximal order types -- an oft-discussed topic during a recent visit by Harry Altman -- as a function of the labeling wqo. Using their correspondence to finitary indecomposable transfinite sequences, we'll also get a nice result for all finitary sequences of length less than \(\omega^\omega\). <br>

This is joint work with Fedor Pakhomov, and overlapping with a recent paper by Andreas Weiermann and Harvey Friedman.

  <details><summary>Title: Relations between the Ramsey theorem and other important theorems</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: The Ramsey theorem is an important result that will be treated from a reverse mathematics perspective. Considering the Hindman theorem and the Increasing Polarized Theorem, we will restrict each other to the version on couples and two colours, and then compare these theorems with other conditions and stronger versions to find some interesting equivalences, and see if over \(\mathsf{RCA}_0\) it is possible to prove that these three theorems are equivalent to each other.

  <details><summary>Title: New results on incompleteness and ordinal analysis</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract:  We present an analogue of Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem. Whereas Gödel showed that sufficiently strong theories that are \(\Pi^0_1\)-sound and \(\Sigma^0_1\)-definable do not prove their own \(\Pi^0_1\)-soundness, we prove that sufficiently strong theories that are \(\Pi^1_1\)-sound and \(\Sigma^1_1\)-definable do not prove their own \(\Pi^1_1\)-soundness. Our proof does not involve the construction of a self-referential sentence but rather relies on ordinal analysis.

If time permits, we will then turn to characterizations of ordinal analysis itself. One of the main goals of ordinal analysis is measuring the “strength” of theories by calculating their proof-theoretic ordinals. But in what sense do proof-theoretic ordinals measure the strength of theories? What is the attendant notion of strength? We provide some abstract answers to this question.

  <details><summary>Title: Complete representation by partial functions for signatures containing antidomain restriction</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract:  In [1], Jackson and Stokes investigate the axiomatisability of classes of algebras that are representable as (i.e. isomorphic to) an algebra of partial functions. Using a uniform method of representation, they give, for around 30 different signatures containing the domain restriction operation, either a finite equational or finite quasi-equational axiomatisation of the class of representable algebras. Only a handful of these classes had previously been axiomatised.

We show that a similar uniform method of representation can be used to characterise many of the corresponding subclasses of completely representable algebras. A complete representation is one that turns any existing infima/suprema into intersections/unions. Specifically, we do this for signatures containing the operation called minus in [1] and which we call antidomain restriction; thus for about half of the signatures treated in [1]. Together with the results of [1], this gives us finite first-order axiomatisations of 11 of these classes of completely representable algebras. Only a couple of complete representation classes had previously been axiomatised (for representation as partial functions). <br>

  <details><summary>Title: Provable bqo's</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: It is a known result that any theory T extending RCA_0 which proves that 3 is bqo also proves that any finite poset is bqo. Interestingly, as Freund recently showed, 3 being bqo is not a trivial statement, as it entails ACA_0^+ over RCA_0 (an implication not known to be strict). Hence, a natural question to be asked is: what can we say about the finite posets P that a "weak" theory (i.e., a theory not proving that 3 is bqo) proves to be bqo? In this talk, we will provide a characterization of these posets, and then extend this result to study the posets that ACA_0 proves to be bqo. Finally, we will show how these considerations can be exploited to show the weakness of some versions of the minimal bar array lemma. <br>
    
This is joint work with Anton Freund, Alberto Marcone and Fedor Pakhomov.

  <details><summary>Title: The phase transition for Friedman's Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: We cover our recent findings regardings the parameterized Friedman's Bolzano Weierstrass theorem FBW_f where f is a positive primitive recursive function. Our aim is to indicate the precise threshold region for f for which FBW_f becomes unprovable in the fragment of PA with one quantifier induction only.

  <details><summary>Title: An Introduction to Integer Complexity </summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: The *integer complexity* of a number n, denoted ||n||, is the smallest number of 1's needed to write n using any combination of addition and multiplication.  Despite this simple definition many problems about it remain open; for instance, it is unknown whether ||2^k||=2k for all k>=1. <br>

In this talk we'll provide an overview of integer complexity, discussing its approximate magnitude, how fast it may be computed, and some infinite families of numbers we *can* determine the complexity of, but focusing primarily on a well-ordering phenomenon that occurs when one transforms the complexity values into real-valued "defects".  We'll also discuss variants of the problem.

  <details><summary>No title</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: Given a finite collection of well-orders, the lower sets of their Cartesian product form a well partial order under inclusion.  In this talk we'll discuss how the type of this well partial order may be computed (both with and without a boundedness restriction) and why the resulting function takes the specific form that it does.  Time permitting we may discuss variants of the problem.

  <details><summary> Title: Higman and Kruskal in Reverse Mathematics </summary>
  <p>
   Abstract: Higman’s lemma and Kruskal’s theorem are two of the most celebrated results in the theory of well quasi-orders. In his seminal paper, G. Higman obtained what is known as Higman’s lemma as a corollary of a more general theorem, dubbed here Higman’s theorem.
J.B. Kruskal was well aware of this more general set up; in the very end of his famous article, he explicitly stated how Higman’s theorem is a special version, restricted to trees of finite branching degree, of Kruskal’s own tree theorem.
In this talk, we present proof-theoretic relations between different version of Higman's and Kruskal's theorems, establishing also their proof-theoretic ordinals. <br>

 <details><summary> Title: The Logical Strength of Minimal Bad Array </summary>
  <p>
   Abstract: The notion of better quasi order, due to Nash-Williams, has led to a rich body of results, which includes Laver’s famous proof of Fraïssé’s conjecture. A central tool is the minimal bad array principle. In the present paper, we show that this principle is exceptionally strong from the viewpoint of reverse mathematics, a framework from mathematical logic. Specifically, it is equivalent to Π¹₂-comprehension over the base theory ATR₀. <br>
