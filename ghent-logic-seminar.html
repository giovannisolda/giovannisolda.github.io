 <p>
  The Ghent Logic Seminar takes place weekly, usually at 11pm (CET) on Thursdays. Most of the seminars can be attended either in person or on Zoom. For the zoom link, or for the recording of the talks, get in touch with <a href="http://cage.ugent.be/~weierman/">Andreas Weiermann</a>, <a href="https://research.ugent.be/web/person/fedor-pakhomov-0/en">Fedor Pakhomov</a>, or <a href="https://giovannisolda.github.io/">me</a>.

  <details><summary>Title: The phase transition for Friedman's Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: We cover our recent findings regardings the parameterized Friedman's Bolzano Weierstrass theorem FBW_f where f is a positive primitive recursive function. Our aim is to indicate the precise threshold region for f for which FBW_f becomes unprovable in the fragment of PA with one quantifier induction only.

  <details><summary>Title: An Introduction to Integer Complexity </summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: The *integer complexity* of a number n, denoted ||n||, is the smallest number of 1's needed to write n using any combination of addition and multiplication.  Despite this simple definition many problems about it remain open; for instance, it is unknown whether ||2^k||=2k for all k>=1. <br>

In this talk we'll provide an overview of integer complexity, discussing its approximate magnitude, how fast it may be computed, and some infinite families of numbers we *can* determine the complexity of, but focusing primarily on a well-ordering phenomenon that occurs when one transforms the complexity values into real-valued "defects".  We'll also discuss variants of the problem.

  <details><summary>No title</summary>
   <p>
    Abstract: Given a finite collection of well-orders, the lower sets of their Cartesian product form a well partial order under inclusion.  In this talk we'll discuss how the type of this well partial order may be computed (both with and without a boundedness restriction) and why the resulting function takes the specific form that it does.  Time permitting we may discuss variants of the problem.

  <details><summary> Title: Higman and Kruskal in Reverse Mathematics </summary>
  <p>
   Abstract: Higman’s lemma and Kruskal’s theorem are two of the most celebrated results in the theory of well quasi-orders. In his seminal paper, G. Higman obtained what is known as Higman’s lemma as a corollary of a more general theorem, dubbed here Higman’s theorem.
J.B. Kruskal was well aware of this more general set up; in the very end of his famous article, he explicitly stated how Higman’s theorem is a special version, restricted to trees of finite branching degree, of Kruskal’s own tree theorem.
In this talk, we present proof-theoretic relations between different version of Higman's and Kruskal's theorems, establishing also their proof-theoretic ordinals. <br>

 <details><summary> Title: The Logical Strength of Minimal Bad Array </summary>
  <p>
   Abstract: The notion of better quasi order, due to Nash-Williams, has led to a rich body of results, which includes Laver’s famous proof of Fraïssé’s conjecture. A central tool is the minimal bad array principle. In the present paper, we show that this principle is exceptionally strong from the viewpoint of reverse mathematics, a framework from mathematical logic. Specifically, it is equivalent to Π¹₂-comprehension over the base theory ATR₀. <br>
