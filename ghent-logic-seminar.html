  The Ghent Logic Seminar takes place weekly, usually at 11pm (CET) on Thursdays. Most of the seminars can be attended either in person or on Zoom. For the zoom link, or for the recording of the talks, get in touch with <a href="http://cage.ugent.be/~weierman/">Andreas Weiermann</a>, <a href="https://research.ugent.be/web/person/fedor-pakhomov-0/en">Fedor Pakhomov</a>, or <a href="https://giovannisolda.github.io/">me</a>.

  <details><summary> Title: Higman and Kruskal in Reverse Mathematics </summary>
  <p>
   Abstract: Higman’s lemma and Kruskal’s theorem are two of the most celebrated results in the theory of well quasi-orders. In his seminal paper, G. Higman obtained what is known as Higman’s lemma as a corollary of a more general theorem, dubbed here Higman’s theorem.
J.B. Kruskal was well aware of this more general set up; in the very end of his famous article, he explicitly stated how Higman’s theorem is a special version, restricted to trees of finite branching degree, of Kruskal’s own tree theorem.
In this talk, we present proof-theoretic relations between different version of Higman's and Kruskal's theorems, establishing also their proof-theoretic ordinals.

  Joint work with Peter Schuster and Andreas Weiermann

 <details><summary> Title: The Logical Strength of Minimal Bad Array </summary>
  <p>
   Abstract: The notion of better quasi order, due to Nash-Williams, has led to a rich body of results, which includes Laver’s famous proof of Fraïssé’s conjecture. A central tool is the minimal bad array principle. In the present paper, we show that this principle is exceptionally strong from the viewpoint of reverse mathematics, a framework from mathematical logic. Specifically, it is equivalent to Π¹₂-comprehension over the base theory ATR₀.
